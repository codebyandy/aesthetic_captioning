Perhaps this is the feeling you were going for and if so you succeeded.  :)  However I find it a visceral distraction.  I think perhaps I'm reacting to an absence of the strong foreground lines elsewhere in the image. So there is an imbalance for me.  For instance if there were clouds that formed receding lines into the distance, a pattern that mimicked the perspective of the vineyard rows, I think the composition would have a lot more power. On the positive side, there is a very paradoxical appearance to the diminishing lines of the rows.  Its almost like an M.C. Escher print where you look at the rows and think they are moving in one direction but then it appears that they are receding in a different direction.

You did a great job being careful of what parts of the background were showing around the wallaroo's face.  For example, there are no branches coming out of his head.

However I don't think that the offsetting of, what readily appears to be the stacking of duplicate layers of the doorway and wall image, works particularly well as presented.  I like that you have experimented with the accidental slippage of the layer with this, and can see the potential here as to what might be possible using this 'look'. But I think the execution here leaves the image with an 'unfocused' and confounding appearance, rather than creating dynamic tension, and/or a mystifying surreal effect.  My first thought here was 'is this image out of focus.  It wasn't that I thought the image was enigmatic and thought provoking, but rather that somehow the underlying layer had slipped out of place. Its tough to fool the eye into seeing something you want it to see if it can instantly recognize the mechanics behind the technique.  I think that by using this technique you have diminished from the simple power of the original structural lines and confounded the viewers eye into missing the elegance of the lines, and being confused by their confluence. I also like the counterpoint to the stark minimalistic power of the structure with the enigmatic figure of the woman.  There are some issues with her placement that I will discuss below.

Really the one compositional question that I have is whether the centering of the subject here is the best choice.  The textbook answer is \"no\", my answer is different.In shooting an image like this quickly, it's inevitable that the subject will be somewhat centered, particularly if you're using autofocus.  I'll often shoot that way and crop to achieve a more energetic composition.But is that desirable here?The usual conventional wisdom would be to crop in from the bottom and the left, leaving the animal more room to move into.  That's a mistake here for a couple reasons, the look of the animal is in part that it's jumping, the motion is upward, and cutting in from the bottom would reduce the sense of space underneath the animal.  And you'd lose a lot of that luxurious green.An alternative approach is to have the animal \"almost leaving\" the frame, a style which often conveys a quirkier mood here, by cutting in from the top and/or right.  I wouldn't cut in from the top (again, the greens).The real question is the right side.The centered composition is (in the textbooks) decried for lack of energy.  But there's no lack of energy here in the image as you've rendered it.  The symmetry is nice, the textures, animal position and blur, all have more than enough gentle but interesting energy to make this image a success.I like the image as it is, and I also like the image as it would be if cropped in from the right into more or less a square.  Both are equally valid images, and they have different moods, it's a matter of what mood you're hoping to convey.One final compositional note:  Love the soft diagonals in the road and in the greenery, too.

There is no hair blowing, and their fingers are perfectly still, almost as though they are cut-outs. It's also strange that the grass is sharp and unwavering and yet the flags are blowing around in quite a breeze.Another puzzle is that the flags seem to have varing degrees of blur on them, and some of them seem blurred inside the flag but sharp around the edges. The flag on the far left seems sharp and blurred at one and the same time - and doesn't look \"real\", to my eyes. Another puzzle is that there doesn't seem to be any reflection of light from the monument onto the children - no rim light or backlight - and they seem quite opaque as silhouettes, and even if the shot is genuine with no post-processing, they seem quite lifeless and \"cut-out\".The height between the top of the tallest child and the top of the nearest flag pole is also puzzling.Rather than admiring the image - I have found myself spending a lot of time of trying to work out what is \"wrong\" with it. I would be interested to know what post-processing (PhotoShop) techniques if any were. If none at all, then it's a remarkable capture which leaves me feeling a bit \"cold\" unfortunately - which is the opposite, I suppose, of what was intended.I have to say that while I am not saying for certain that the image was manipulated in any way, I am saying that it does have that sort of unrealistic quality to it, unfortunately, which detracts from any emotional quailty it might otherwise have had, for me.

Usually it is whilst I am on holiday and in the past I have stalked a few deer for the fun of it! However, some principles do obviously effect all photography and I can perhaps advise with those in mind.What we have here is a reasonable image of a snake. To be perfectly honest, it does not really do much for me in terms of interest. To me the point of taking a shot of an animal is to either show it as a perfect specimen, in its natural surroundings, doing what it is best known for, or doing something cute or unusual. You tell me in your short description that this snake is grumpy and in the full tilt strike position, but personally I do not get that from the picture. Yes it's rearing up a bit, but what happened in the next frame or the one after that? Perhaps this is a dangerous snake and you didn't want to get too close? I would say though that if you want to specialise in animal photography or snakes in particular, then you will have to be dedicated and very patient. It will take more than one shot to capture the beast at its best!So, to sum up. Not a very interesting picture unless you are a snake afficiendo. There has to be more to interest the viewer in a case like this. The snake has to look angry or grumpy! It has to be at the point of striking or in the process so that you see the fangs!

As I said earlier, this photo has such a timeless feel due to your conversion to BW. It reminds me of an image one of our beloved street photographers of the 1950s may have taken. If you get a chance I recommend that you look up Vivian Maier, http://www.vivianmaier.com. She was a daring young photographer who lived in NYC and Chicago during the 50s who wandered the streets to capture the essence of everyday life in those cities.

But in this case I disagree with that \"rule\". I feel that you have so much interest on either side of the fountain that placing the fountain in the center of the frame balances the composition. For me, the center of interest is the group of people on the lower right of the frame, though the fountain is your main focal point. The bird on the upper left and the large open space on the left also balance the darks on the large dark area on the right created by the skyscrapers. Lovely composition. I also feel that your perspective is fantastic! I love that fact that you are lower than the rest of the scene when shooting. By shooting at this POV you are elevating the importance and prominence of the people and the others elements in the scene. Your use of lines, vertical and horizontal, keep the viewer's eye moving around within the frame. There is a lot to keep the viewer interested and wanting to explore within the borders of the frame. Cropping vertically adds to the tension of the tall fountain and buildings. Yet the casual and relaxed group of people gathering at the base of the fountain add a wonderful calm contrast to the harshness of the city.

From the elevated angle I'm guessing you're either up a tree or standing on the top side of a slope. Consider a lower angle. You have tall straight thin trees in this forest. These provide a steady vertical linear quality throughout the picture which is easy on the eyes and accentuates the furnace but imagine how intimidating it would look shooting a portrait of the furnace from a low angle so the treetops hang threateningly over the old decrepit man-made relic. You have to decide what you want to show. For example, nature's power over the man-made, or man's creation boldly surviving in nature. Perhaps you want to show a marriage of both so you could go close to the furnace and shoot the bricked arch leading into the forest.

Often, when shooting light things like snow or cloudy skies, it's necessary to use some exposure compensation (+1 or even more) to get clean, bright whites.  It may seem \"backwards\" to use exposure compensation to \"make light things even lighter\", but that's not the right way to think about it.  The camera doesn't know, when it looks at a subject, whether it's a dark object in a lot of light, or a light object in not as much light.  So it tries to make every photograph look kinda average in terms of brightness.  A scene that is particularly light or dark colored sometimes needs, as a result, positive or negative exposure compensation to get the right look.

There are five components in this (rather unusual) still life:the landscape backgroundthe easelthe bushthe transparent framethe hatFrom the point of view of compositional balance, the pictorial space is tilting heavily to the left; both the patch of woods and the hat on the left have no counterbalance on the right.  An easy fix would be to flip the landscape, so that the patch of woods is on the right, which besides giving balance to the image, would also put something more interesting behind the transparent frame.The easel is a bit of an overpowering presence and it imposes itself as the center of attention.  Perhaps, a selective desaturation of its color might improve the situation.  Also, cloning out the labels should make the easel less imposing.The brush on top of the easel is a nice touch, however its color is competing with the color of the sky.  Perhaps a selective desaturation of its color might also improve the image.The transparent frame should be the center of attention (not the easel), but its very transparency makes that hard to achieve.  Perhaps, some extra selective saturation and vibrancy of only the pixels within the frame might help.  Alternatively, reducing the vibrancy and saturation of everything outside the transparent frame should work.As far as the placement of the transparent frame in the overall image, I think that changing the camera position a bit, would make the right border of the transparent frame parallel to the right border of the overall image, and that would provide less distraction to the viewing eye.  Alternatively, perspective correction in Photoshop or even selective lens correction in Lightroom, might help.The hat is a good symbolic presence in the image, and the fact that it's underexposed might even work to add a bit of mystery to the overall image.I believe that this image could be strengthened by using a square format rather than the landscape format."}, {"category": "nature-photography", "subject_of_photo": "Well James, I'm not sure what exactly is the subject here!

If that was the feeling you wanted me to have, then you were a successful photographer.", "reviewer": "Gary Strader", "composition": "This is an interesting composition! There are so many feature elements in this shot that one could focus on. Those elements can work for you or against you. The scene from my eyes tell me that you need to have taken several photos, each one telling the many stories that are begging to be told. First you have that lighthouse atop the hill. The lighthouse alone could make an interesting photo. Of course there is the water, and how about those rocks in the foreground, such an interesting assortment of detail in them. What seems to be your subject in this shot, the water, it looks like the fog is just forming just above the water line. I know that you used a long exposure to achieve the effect, and I will discuss that idea further a little later.You used good rules for your composition;however, sometimes you need not become too rigid with the rules. Yes, it is true that one should use the lowest ISO, and the widest aperture to capture a breath taking scene. Your ISO was too low  for the late day overcast sky. If I had taken the shot, I would not have gone below ISO 200, and more likely I would have shot this at ISO 400 or above. The reason,is you must give first consideration to the available light. An overcast sky can allow you to gather details that would otherwise get blown out on a sunny day. However, when you shoot at say ISO 100 late in the day and it is overcast, at that ISO your camera can not react to the dim light well enough to yield too much detail.Way back when,back in the day, Kodak Film Packages were labeled at first with ASA values, which later became the more universally known ISO. ASA/ISO referred to the films sensitivity to light. The lower numbers were for bright sunny days, ISO 100, ISO 200. For shade, and overcast conditions; ASA/ISO 400. ISO 200 was twice as sensitive to light as ISO 100, ISO 400 was twice as sensitive to light as ISO 400, and so forth. That is a good way to relate to ISO on your digital camera, as it is dialing in the sensitivity to light as it relates to the camera sensor.I do like the perspective your photo was taken, that angle works well with that lighthouse, especially so if it were at night and the light was shining, and in the center of the photo, or placed in the upper left with the beam of light shining off to the right out into the night.

On top you can see that the wholes in the grid are totally white and indistinguishable from the margin.This is a big step forward and these errors that we still have here are a great learning experience. Be careful not to loose texture on the shadows and highlights but don't go the other way like in the previous one. Shadows are supposed to be dark even if we get all texture on them, and the same goes for brightness in the highlights, not loosing texture.I can see that there is an appeal on the side of the church but this composition looks like this is a detail from a bigger picture.Regarding the vertical lines this is a good attempt but you have to do what I suggested in my message earlier.

And going away from what is confirmed it work is hard and needs skill and sensibility.You've given this Red Dragon enough space for it to breathe in the surrounding area, and the fact that you've chosen to give more space to the top and left puts it in a position of achievement. It's not about where it came from but where it will go. If you had framed it strictly according to the rule of thirds this would not have the same intention. Firstly because the mere fact of framing by the book is less capable of giving the profundity of meaning that you have here (some people just do it because the book says to). Secondly because this way we have a more intimate relation with the dragonfly without loosing all framing intention. To just have it very close so that we could perfectly see the eyes and other details would not be so interesting as a shot but more as a piece of evidence, good for science.Also, by framing it the way you did, it's the Dragon that has the predominant presence as the animal that it is and not only as the incredible shape that it has or very vivid and compelling colour we see. This is not just a graphical image, this is a very dynamic image.Although the focus is not on the eyes, something that for us humans is always distracting or disturbing (the first thing we look at when we see an animal are the eyes) because it forces a non relation and we have to search for the focus.

In fact, the monochrome effect enhances the moodiness of the overall photograph.", "general_impression": "Hi Deigh! Your technical execution of your creative vision here is spectacular.  I can almost feel the water moving and the fog swirling above.  Excellent job filling your frame with your primary message/subject as we are able to enjoy your image with few distractions.

Overall, very well done - just a couple of minor composition and exposure recommendations to make a great image even stronger.  Nicely done and thank you for sharing your work with me!", "reviewer": "Colleen Miniuk-Sperry", "composition": "Two things grab me right away with your composition: your layers and lines.  The image possesses a strong illusion of depth because of how you've utilized the rocks in the foreground, the river in the middle, another set of rocks with trees on top, and interspersed fog towards the top of the frame. All of these components convey excellent spatial relationship between the different visual objects.  While a significant portion of the visual weight (heavier objects and darker tones) fall towards the top of the image (which makes the image feel a little top heavy if you consider our perceptions of gravity...), you have created a nice sense of overall asymmetrical balance by positioning the river and foreground rocks as you have.It's an even bigger payoff when your foreground rocks create a triangle shape and your river line runs from bottom left to top right (or vice versa).  These both create a sense of movement across your entire frame. Also, your elevated perspective provides a nice angle to view this scene - it feels like we're soaring above it or enjoying from an overlook.If we remember that the viewer's eye is most attracted to the brightest part of the frame, I find my eye goes immediately to the bottom left corner.  Because that tone sits on the edge of the frame, it's serving to pull the viewer's eye out of the frame.  I'd recommend either selectively darkening that corner so it serves as a stronger visual anchor (and thus, keeps the eye in the frame vs. pulling it out of it) OR crop the frame from the bottom.  I would not recommend cropping from the right side to remove this tone, as the fallen trees serve as effective lines pointing back to your primary subject - the river.Also, the darkened/silhouetted tree breaks up the line of the river towards the top of the frame simply because the tones differ significantly from the whiter-toned river.  Not much you can do to resolve that (especially if you're standing on the edge of a cliff!!), other than to just simply be aware of its existence and position yourself to get the best angle possible (which I believe you've done).  To emphasize and frame the line of the river a little more effectively, I would have liked to have seen a little more of the rocks on the left side (so in the field spin your camera to left an inch or two towards those rocks)."}, {"category": "architectual-photography", "subject_of_photo": "Not even sure what the subject is other than some tubes but it is a great perspective.

My first reaction to the color of the photograph (at least here on this monitor) was that it might be a little oversaturated, particularly the stripe of sea. However, after some experimentation I found that, on my monitor, just the slightest tweak to the white balance towards the warm (one or two points towards yellow on the LIghtroom 4 white balance slider, if you use that tool) brought a more natural looking result--I don't think the issue I was noticing was, in the end, a saturation issue at all.  ", "general_impression": "Hi Mark,The very first thing that struck me about this image was the seeing, the stripes, and that was very effective for me, as were the variety of colors and textures within the stripes.  You might enjoy keeping an eye out for situations that would offer up similar situations, I think a group of photographs exploring the horizontally-striped landscape could develop into a really interesting body of work.  Most importantly, keep up the habit of \"looking around\", and being aware of what's going on in all directions, as you did here.  Some of my favorite images have only come my way because I've internalized the habit of looking around, and trying to be aware of what else is happening around me.  Well done.", "reviewer": "Joe Decker", "composition": "The high vantage point and telephoto look create a very nice perspective here, which provides a firm foundation for this composition.  There's enough variation in the stripe heights to be interesting and dynamic. I'm not in any way a slave to the rule of thirds, but some of the stripe edges fall near those thirds and the overall result is pleasing, no matter what the so-called rules say.  You left a good stripe of room above the clouds, too.  Nicely done.Only one element really mars simplicity of the colors and textures here, and that's the open area front and center.  I don't know if shooting in a different direction would have allowed you to avoid it without creating greater distractions, I'm guessing that there was, as there usually is, little alternative.However, there is another way to deal with that area. Cropping the image from the bottom to remove it, leaving in a thinner stripe of dark green, would have two effects.  First, it would remove the distraction, putting even more emphasis on the pattern of stripes.  Second, by reframing the composition into a wider, more cinematic shape, you'd find that the panoramic shape of the image helps guide the viewer's eye back and forth horizontally, enhancing the effect of the horizontal stripes.   While the resulting image would put the horizon closer to the middle, I don't think that's a problem here, the resulting image still feels dynamic and interesting.I'll have a few comments in the final section of this review about post-processing tweaks that are particularly important if you do decide to make that crop."}, {"category": "documentry-photography", "subject_of_photo": "Details from boots or fisherman working are very characteristic.

I think you might consider looking at color balance in the blue part of the sky as it seems to have a bit of a magenta cast to it. This isn't 'wrong' since sunsets and clouds during those hours often contain a magenta hue from my experience.  Sometimes though it can be a bit vexing because it shows up in prints and on the computer screen more readily than your eye tends to see it. If you find that you want to remove it, there is a 'selective color' adjustment in Photoshop that lets you remove or change the hue balance in all your major color areas.

I realize that you get what you get often times when shooting landscapes, but a composition with less in the way of spring melt remnants, (the sheer number of floating ice fragments and the rather haphazard way they rest in the image, is just a little bit distracting from the overall image. I think that the water moving in the foreground is interesting on two counts: The first being that it creates a motion that gives fluidity to the image, and the second being that it seemingly flows into an area of relative calm.

I like that you have attempted to provide a sense of symmetry and balance by lining up the boots by their relative height and that mechanism works okay.

The placement of the boots in the dead center of the composition I think draws the eye to them, but also lends a static and motionless sort of feel to the composition as well. Having one white pair among the other black ones provides nice contrast but I think the placement of the boots, both in juxtaposition with the group, and in the frame in general is less dynamic than an offset composition might be. I can see the curving road in the image and it provides a bit of leading line and s curve to the image but its power is diminished by the fact that the boots obscure most of the lines of the road, and thus the effect that it might have in leading the eye into the frame is substantially diminished. I think too that the background, though blurred, contains a lot of distracting detail that, for the sort of image you have taken that attempts to showcase the boots, tends to distract from the subject. I feel a bit woozy when I look at the image because it appears that you oriented your image to ensure that the boots were straight and as a result the natural horizon in the background is canted considerably.  This technique is not a bad thing but I don't think it works as well here as it would for say an edgy wedding photo of two people running on the beach and the image shot from ground up.  For such a static image as yours I think that slanting the horizon doesn't provide the dynamic pop that it would for a moving subject.

I think the composition is less powerful than it could be in that it is appears to present a little flatter than one might expect having a more static look of a horizontal orientation, despite the diagonal and nearly vertical lines of the two grass blades in the foreground. These leading lines for the most part travel from frame bottom to top and side to side off the edges. So do not, to any great degree, lead your eye into the composition. The anchor that does assist in getting lost here is the large dew drop placed almost center frame.  I do however, like the way the blades cross overlap the large dewdrop, as this provides a modicum of motion and dynamism and  also creates a sense of depth that wouldn't be as obvious otherwise. I think one reason for the feeling that the motion in the image moves primarily horizontally is that the capture is a landscape orientation, which is not a bad thing, but I think in this case you could have increased the power of the image by using perhaps a horizontal composition when you captured the image.

You've used a wide angle lens, which is fine, though for that focal length (10mm) I would suggest trying to point the lens to the sky. You could \"crop\" the darker portion of this scene in camera by tilting the camera upward to get more of the interesting sky.I also see the opportunity for a longer focal length (200 - 300mm), particularly in the center supports and those multiple \"X\"s and downward curve, as a vertical composition with reflection and sky.

Individually minor, each does give my eye an excuse to pull away a bit from the primary subject matter.  The biggest distraction is probably the rock in the lower-right corner, which pulls the eye away in part because of its brightness, our eyes are naturally attracted to brighter elements in a scene.  But the chain, to some extent the warm wet rock in the river along the bottom edge, and perhaps the stairstep stones in the upper right can be distracting--I do sort of like the latter.  There is something about objects just at the edge of a frame that makes them particularly able to create a bit of distraction. This is probably one of the things I like best about using a tripod, it gives me a little more time to examine the edges for distractions while I'm composing.  I'm guessing you used one too, the image is sharp, beyond my ability to handhold at a sixth of a second. It is possible that a very slight crop of the bottom of the image could eliminate the rock and reduce the distractions in the bottom right.  One could also come in a bit from the right, but that starts cutting up the drain, I'm not sure that by itself would help.  I won't suggest trying to remove them with Photoshop. Before the shot was taken, it is possible that a slightly different position would have helped avoid this, but it may not have been (safely) possible, and every movement changes the relationship of other elements in the picture--it's difficult for me to tell what alternatives were possible without being on the ground there myself.  What I would have been looking for, in alternatives positions, is keeping the full arch and the basic diagonal of the water, and seeing if it were possible to get more water (the color of which is quite nice) while orchestrating any distracting elements off the edges.

One can be remedied in post processing, but the other is such an embedded element in your photo that it works against what you have tried to do.  The first is the light branches that extend into your composition from the upper part of the frame. These can be removed however via post processing.  The other issue as I see it is the large blob of ice that, when placed in the upper part of the composition is no longer recognizable as art but looks like a flaw in the image, damage of some sort, or a stain of some sort that distracts the eye from the symmetry I think you wanted to preserve.  Sometimes an element will work to your advantage by creating interesting dissonance, but in this case it simply looks like a blemish.  Its interesting that when the image is returned to its normal orientation, that area immediately becomes recognizable as lake ice. I think if your image did not contain the ice, your choice of flipping the orientation would have worked fairly well considering that then inverted you relegate the blown out sky area to the bottom and the darker area of water takes on a more voluminous and multi dimensional look.  I do like the shape of the vertical center tree as it curves in a rather circuitous route downwards and provides a sense of dynamic motion to an otherwise placid scene.

You'll remember the ambient sounds (birds, automobiles, the rural environment). You'll remember the smell of the air and the vegetation.  You may remember it as a particular time in your life. In other words, you'll remember the total experience of you being in that place at that time.Consequently, when you later view this image, it will mean more to you, and be more attractive to you, than it can be for anyone else.A viewer like me can only experience the place visually through your photograph. No sounds, smells, warmth or coolness on the skin...breeze through the hair, etcetera. That's what makes it hard for a documentary image of an ordinary scene to hold the interest of someone who doesn't have a connection with it.Your image doesn't hold my interest because it's an average snapshot. But I would like to be honest and say that I would struggle to make an interesting image in this place if my PoV was dictated solely by a bridge. If I had a longer lens than your 18-55mm lens I might be able to do something more with the scene by zooming in on particular details and seeing what I could do with them in terms of composition. There are interesting elements in the scene: vegetation; river; reflections; textures; light and shade; the high viewpoint. But it will take a good eye for composition to extract something more than an average snapshot from this scene.Thank you for choosing me to critique your image, Annelly.

You were passing by on a bridge, so you may have had little time to explore the location to look for a compelling viewpoint. Perhaps it was too dangerous or difficult to look for a position away from the bridge. Whatever the reason, taking a photograph from the bridge doesn't help you to make a great photograph if the view from the bridge is ordinary. The photograph that you took from the bridge will likely be similar to photographs that many other people have taken from that bridge before or in the future. You've used your lens at its maximum focal length so it wasn't possible to zoom further in to specific areas of interest within the scene...unless you had another lens in your bag. If you had a longer lens, it would have been a good idea to use it, in my opinion."}, {"category": "landscape-photography", "subject_of_photo": "Liam, I think you captured the mood that you were attempting very well.

It's pretty good considering the hardware. Of course that for it to have a good look it needs some 'masking' like that of those app adding effects for this and that. Anyway, I'm not going to put that down to, because it has a place in photography.For a quick snapshot with no requirements on technical quality, that point & shoot that most of us do with our cell phones, iPhone is a winner. For some types of low-fi art projects iPhone can be interesting. For quality work a minimum quality camera is advised.Regarding what you've done here, I feel a contradiction. The composition is not that old style so if in one hand you found a way to capture these two nice old school bikes, in the other hand the effect of an old lens with lot's of vignetting doesn't really match the angle and proximity of this shot. So I guess that wile your objective was getting there in the effect it's not on the angle and composition.Keep using your iPhone!

Most would agree that the compact camera you've used is not the ideal equipment for wildlife photography, but it's hard to argue that in relation to your image. You do seem to have got close enough to make a good photograph of a small bird. Your shutter speed of 1/89s on auto and the moderately wide aperture (for this camera) of f4.1 may be contributing to the lack of apparent sharpness or focus. I can see that the light must have been quite low to require 1/89s @ f4.1 & ISO 100. You could have increased ISO to 200 or 400 to allow a faster shutter or higher aperture number and that may have improved the crispness of the image.

Thank you for choosing me to critique your image. I hope that my comments seem both fair and useful to you. If you can take one or two things away from this that you can use next time then I'll have done my job.The hummingbird appeals to me as a subject although in this case there are a number of things that have let the image down. I mentioned earlier that I like the general composition. It's conventional and safe and that's OK. You had to work quickly with what was presented.Being a zoologist by training, I was interested to learn more about the Bearded Helmetcrest. That sent me off 'a Googling' to satisfy my curiosity. I've now seen a number of photographs of this species, and that helps me to make some suggestions for your 'next time'.I have seen, in other images, that this species has some interesting head and facial markings. Unfortunaely, they're not apparent in your photograph.I think that the main failing of this image, in terms of holding my interest, is that the bird isn't doing anything interesting and looks glum. Photographs of birds simply perching on sticks are common. We need to bring back something more than that to grab the viewer's attention. Hummingbirds are dynamic creatures and this one isn't very dynamic. Admittedly, capturing it on the wing would be another kettle of fish, but there are some things that you could do to make even this static capture of the Bearded Helmetcrest more interesting.Indeed, with its fluffed feathers, this little fellow gives me the impression that it's either ailing or cold (perhaps it was a cool cloudy day, even for the Columbian or Venezuelan rainforest). Maybe it's a bad day for a nectar feeder because the sun isn't out and the flowers aren't open. Your hummingbird doesn't appear to be living up to its frenetic reputation. It's not humming along!I hope the suggestions below give you some food for thought. All the best with your photography, Carl. If it moves you, shoot it!Rob Smith AAPS ", "reviewer": "Rob Smith AAPS", "composition": "I like the diagonal dynamic of the composition. The bird's visual weight is counterbalanced by the larger shape of the plant anchored in bottom right corner. Together these two elements create a quasi triangular shape that points to the top left hand corner. That's the diagonal dynamic I refer to.I like that the photographer's point of view (PoV) seems to be slightly below the bird's eye level. This has the viewer looking slightly up to the hummingbird. This also enhances the dominance of the bird as main subject. You must have been very close to the bird because I see that the focal length used was equivalent to about 70mm on a full frame camera. That's pretty close to have such a small bird dominate the frame. Unless, of course, the image was heavily cropped.Negative space is the empty space in a composition that surrounds physical elements. In this case, the negative space is the dull grey background that lets the bird and plant be viewed without distractions. You've made very good use of compositional negative space and contrast. The relationship between negative and positive space is also called a figure-ground relationship (a figure against its background). We can also say that this image has pleasing figure-ground shape relationships."}, {"category": "still-life-photography", "subject_of_photo": "Same comments as I've already made", "use_of_camera": "All good, although I imagine the settings are similar to the other shots I've already commented on.", "description": "This is a small variation on what I sent you earlier.

As an in the field wildlife photographer, my preference is to see lighting that looks natural. The background flower has a natural feel to it but the subject does not.  I would suggest placing the light off camera and high up from the side as if it were the sun in mid morning or mid afternoon.

I would also suggest that the main flower be a bit more off center or the whole photo as is cropped so that the two flowers fill nearly all the frame (this would place it off center and in accordance with the rule of thirds).  Overall there is too much dark background.  To get really picky - the parts of flowers hidden behind the main flower are distracting and you should try to move so as to either cover them with the subject (the parts on the left) or make them part of the composition (the flower in profile on the right)  Incidentally, including the flower on the right that is a side shot would have made this composition include 3 different angles: front (almost), 3/4, and side - very interesting study of subject!"}, {"category": "people-photography", "subject_of_photo": "Subject in clear and if I know who this was I would probably find it more interesting.

The wire is a bit of a distraction, but the slight angle adds interest and is way better than a straight horizontal.  In post processing it might be possible to lighten the black a bit to make it softer and pop out less.  I would crop to a portrait orientation and try to eliminate some of the post.

I assume that since the door is open and the ship is so close to the wharf that the ship is not moving and the man is also static. You did not have to use such a fast speed and doing so has darkened your exposure. Not horribly, but half a stop or one stop higher would have provided better contrast and a clearer image. I still think that because of the subject matter the photo should be underexposed anyway. But not so much. An extra point on camera use: you could have opted for a faster speed but with a higher ISO rating. The graininess produced by the high ISO would again build on the atmosphere of the photo.

Concerning the composition. At first glance I would have thought that geometrically speaking the man would have been better discretely placed on the right of the picture with the door on the left and nothing in between. However, I think this would have lessened the importance of the human presence in the picture and taken away its dynamic, so well done on placing the man in the middle. One thing I would have changed if possible is the angle. A wider angle would have looked better if the door was not abruptly cut and the funnels were not right on the edge of the frame. It cuts the continuity of the image and leaves the viewer wanting. Also a wider angle would make the man look smaller in comparison to the boat and this would also build on the atmosphere that the picture conveys without distracting the viewer since it is sunset and the sky is nearly the same shade as the boat. If I couldn't get a wider angle I definitely would have cut some of the wharf to include more sky. The wharf with the tyre tracks and the geometric patterns of the tiles works well but the image would balance better with less wharf and more sky.

Taking a shot from a different angle or even cropping to the rule of thirds could help.Depending on the time of day and if someone was home, seeing the outside light on the porch may have added a sense of city as we are always asked to leave our lights on.

The angle with which the photo was taken could be improved upon, if mirroring of the image was the goal than it accomplished that, but it did not move me. I could not tell what the artist was trying to convey. As photographers we try to create the mood we felt when we took the picture. Again, adding things like the foot prints in the snow, the paper and shooting from different angles keeping in mind the rule of thirds could have helped with this picture. Finding some way to include shadows, maybe even yours would create a better sense of what we are looking at.I believe you did a nice job on contrast with light and dark.

The muted red and greys create an eeriness like something is about to happen if you are not careful.The darkness is the middle is just to distracting for me maybe lighting it up more would make it less distracting  but not putting dead center could help even more here.One of the elements in the photo I would have like to see more of is the railing to the left of the staircase, again shooting from there would change the story but it may be even more interesting.
