There is no particular symmetry, or balance to the image so the eye can wander anywhere it wants to.  There are no margin elements to frame this image, nor any s curves or leading lines to gently guide the viewer around the landscape of the composition. The frame is well filled and there is scarcely anywhere in the frame that doesn't contain some manner of form or texture of interest. Yet, throughout this apparent chaos, a pattern does appear if one looks long enough.  To my eye there are three separate textural areas that define this image.  The periphery of sand forms a sort of defacto frame, the edges of the sea plant define the intermediary shape, and the bubbles within a third region of texture and form.  So, though I might not hang this on my wall, I think it is an enigmatic and fairly well formed abstract work that is both intriguing and captivating.

I am a little confounded by some blotchiness and blurred pixels that appear approximately 1/3 of the way in from the right hand margin at approximately the same level of the surfer.  It appears to be cloning artifacts and upon further inspection takes on a similar shape as the surfer on the left side of the frame.  My first thought is that it looks like a ghost left over from a 'content aware move' of the subject.  I can't be sure but there is something amiss with the pixels in that area which extends downwards into the water where a reflection could be expected had there been an object above it previously.  At any rate if it is cloning or healing artifacts they can be concealed well enough with some more manipulation.

That said I do have a few problems with the image which I will go into under the Composition & Perspective section below. I like the placement of the subject in the image, and it takes up the right amount of room inside the frame. You were here at the tail end of the golden hour, and you took a great deal of time it would seem to set up with the tripod, and this time of day, that loss of time can work against you. Consider getting there a bit sooner to allow you to set up,or take some risks and shoot without the tripod. It all comes down to shooting styles, and technique I suppose, and the critique that I offer you here comes from a different shooting style. I often take risks, and experiment; and I see you as a very careful, and method savvy shooter. You are one that I would bet shoots the same scenes, the same way, always, day after day. Nothing wrong with that, but consider taking some risks, take a walk on the wild side!

It does not take more than 30 seconds for the light to drop off as the sun sinks into the horizon, so consider using this same approach your next outing in the evening.

Mark, I mention this again based on this image, and others that you have posted here. I get the feeling that you are a purist. There is something to be said for that, however this image can be much more than it is with a little tweak here and there. The things I have mentioned earlier with the color boost, the picture control, the high pass, all can be easily changed using Capture NX2, if you took the image as a Raw, NEF file. The best thing about this processing system is that it does an excellent job of color correction using the same software, that your camera uses when the image was taken.

Mark, do not be afraid to experiment with your camera. F8 is fine, but explore, take a few images in Aperture Priority trying different values. Sometimes the image you wanted will be lurking at F4, instead of F8. As a rule of thumb for me, I like to shoot with Prime Lenses because they are faster lenses, which gives a crisper sharper image and is superior in low light conditions. If you do not have at least one, you owe it to have at least one in your camera bag. The Nikkor 50MM F1.8 or the f1.4 are both excellent choices, and they are inexpensive.

Well, I have to agree in a way but this thing is: if you want to do great photography you must be in total control of your camera. And although a compact as this one is more than enough to do great pictures like this snap shot pf yours, there is nothing that compares to using a full featured SLR. But don't get me wrong, I'm thinking about getting one of these for me. The waterproof casings for most SLRs, or DSLRs are prohibitively expensive. It's a too big investment if you're not going to get any profits from it. Any way, if I could just now I would go for the waterproof casing form my Nikon D700, but I can't as is costs more than the camera, so this tough Olympus is a good choice, even if it is a consumer product. It may do the job. But than again, this is good for a kind of a photo diary as a complement to any more serious photography and you used it well.Regarding any of the possible controls of this camera I just don't know, so I'm going to say that this picture is a little over exposed, just a little, because it works like this, although it could be better. But this is something you can correct in any good photo editing software and the correction would be minimal. If your going for the high key is one thing and you should go all the way, making it even more white but taking care that highlights wouldn't loose their texture. The easy way would be to make it just a little darker.The color temperature also needs some work done. The shot is a bit greenish. Not that this is totally wrong, it isn't, but it could be much better if the white balance had been done for the green and cyan dominance in these waters. This, again, is very easy to solve in good software.The speed is fast as it should be to freeze the subject into a crisp and clear look(the way for this photograph to make an impression as it does) but there is nothing to say about this as the camera probably has most of it done from factory and you only have minor choices to do. This is a personal radical sports camera...The focal length you obviously can control, as today all compact cameras that are worthy of buying have a good zoom range and this one seems to have a very good wide-angle range.

It's a good use of the rule of thirds for composition, wile having the frame divided in four in the same time. This is also a pretty valid point of view, though I would like to see the full turtle on a wider frame, and I'm guessing you have some more of that. And maybe, just maybe, you have reframed the picture on a digital post-processing crop. Not saying you shouldn't because if you did you did it well, it works. But the horizontal line could be leveled, it would compliment the perfection of the classical approach.I love the depth of field here. Usually a deep field it's hard to make work unless you're capturing a seamless landscape, blurring the background is a good way of making sure you won't have any unwanted distractions from your subject. Obviously you don't have any problem with your subject, as we only notice the fish, the four fish it seems in the somewhat near background, a few seconds after having recognized the full features of the turtle. This might also be due to a problem we'll discuss ahead.This is almost a high key photograph due to the dominance of light over shadow, but miss interpret what I'm saying, it really works. And it would be very hard to do it otherwise because this see bed is white sand and you clearly have a clean and strong day light working for you. I can't really say it's day light, nor I can vouch this is any sea bed. I could be a very sophisticated aquarium (the perspective of what we have here is quite enclosed, it doesn't need to have been done in a wide space like the sea) and the light, for the water to be crisp clear, could be artificial, some kind of neon maybe...

Your aperture setting of  F/8 is probably pretty much a sweet spot for ensuring good clarity in the image throughout the focal plane.  Therein lies an issue. A larger aperture setting would have allowed you to possibly put the background detail in softer relief and thus 'pop' out your main subject a bit more.  Having said this I'll also acknowledge that it appears you were shooting in lighting conditions that may have been overcast or cloudy (judging from the lack of contrast and shadow detail and it being 5:00 in the afternoon).  So in order to get your background sufficiently soft you would probably had to shoot at an aperture much wider and consequently requiring a shutter speed that was very slow, say three or four stops slower, say at perhaps 1/60.

But here the placement is not a disadvantage considering the rather static posture of the deer - almost as if he had posed for you.  On the other hand, if the deer was in motion and moving from left to right I'd suggest you place the deer in the rightmost third portion of the image to give him 'room to run' so to speak.  Because of the static nature of the image there is very little dynamic tension here.  But since it has the look of an animal portrait that lack of dynamism is not so much a limiting factor.  The background environment in which you shot the deer presents a minor issue in regards to the relative clarity of the subject.  All the competing twigs, branches, leaves and patterns behind the deer, tend to create complex patterns in which the deer is obscured and therefore less prominent to the eye.

There is some loss of texture on the reflections on the water and this is also not to bad but maybe you could have a bit more texture there. You camera sure may have captured most of it if you shot RAW.For a trained eye there is maybe to much contrast and the tone is not helping to convey the power of the storm. I don't even see a storm, I just see the Sum coming through the clouds so this could be the end of a Storm.As for the work you did with taking care of the excess of light on top and the shadowed bottom, I imagine you might have used a graduated neutral density filter during the shot, because the shadows on the rocks at the bottom are great and all texturized but the shadows on the rock on the center are totally lost. This creates a problem because there is an inconsistency and the image ends up looking unrealistic. This is a problem with filter or the use of post productions techniques that resemble the work done with filters.Having said all this, I have to also say that I'm very curious to see more from you and if you are really willing to go the extra mile to get the best out of your amazing camera, I will be very happy to help you through to get to be an amazing shooter.Cheers", "reviewer": "Sara Constana", "composition": "I like the composition very much, it's not obvious and still classic, it works and it's not boring.

The clump of grass in the foreground also creates a very nice element that both frames and provides a sort of visual anchor. Although I usually don't find a relatively central orientation of the horizon in an image, I think in this case it works very well because the elements of interest above and below the horizon are equally interesting and thus worthy of equal treatment. This is a very subtle element, but the inclusion of a single human silhouette on the left side of the image is nicely counterbalanced with the silhouette of the bird.  I think this acts to balance the image even more on a subliminal level.  I do think the horizon line is slightly canted down to the right, not particularly noticable, but just a bit.

The postion of the girls on the right and center are excellent again especailly with the leg and feet position this is excuted beautifully and correct !! the older girl on the left should be positioned more inward to the center girl and the weight of her body should be on the right leg not the left with the knee slighly bent like the other two girls. and maybe her hand on her hip.and her head should be tilted to her left in towards the center.you have created on the good side as well a foregound, middleground and background wellsone htere. this creates the depth that is needed. contrast is good  and leading lines from the gate also helps frame the girls well. The camera angle however is wrong  the camera should be level  in most family if not all portraits, because by tilting the angle here makes them seem like they are falling to the left out of the frame.

For a more dynamic asymmetrical feel, try to position the bush off-centered to the left or right.  OR to emphasize the relationship between the blooming rabbit brush and the beautiful sky in the background, a tighter vertical orientation may have been more effective as this format would eliminate a lot of the extra \"stuff\" on either side of the bush and colorful clouds.  For this frame, I'd recommend cropping into a square format The horizon line is approaching the middle of the frame, so the overall feel to the image feels symmetrical even though symmetry doesn't exist.  This confuses the viewer - should we look as the sky or the land?  Which is more important?  If it's the sky, tilt your camera up higher towards the sky and drop the horizon towards the bottom third of the frame.  If it's the land, tilt your camera down towards the field and raise the horizon towards the top third of the frame.  If it's both, get physically lower (drop your tripod down) and eliminate more of the midground.The lines radiating from the sky serve as visual pathways, especially at the top of the frame.

The sand striations caused by the wind, the sharply delineated shadows which mimic the shapes of the wood, as well as the depressions around each of the wood bodies and the different texture of sand caused by the sand being blown around the stalks.  The small, delicate grass strands also add to the textural feast there.  Having said this I'll say too that I think that these elements do not come together as well in a cohesive manner as they could.  I think the lines of the sand moving in sensual snaking rhythms slightly diagonally from bottom right to upper left, do bring the eye into the composition.  But the horizontal placement, and unevenly sized grouping the three wood shapes tend to fight that movement into the frame and serve as a visual barrier to some degree for me.

The effect of these lines is to move the eye to the right and pretty much off the frame.  This isn't a 'wrong' composition but to my eye it tends to feel a little unbalanced.

Ideally a little air after her too would work well to centre the image and not cut it abruptly without reason. It would also draw and lead the viewer better if you had tilted your camera up a bit when shooting. The floor in the bottom part of the image is unnecessary and doesnt weigh well with the frame that that the shelf on the top creates. It is an abrupt cut-off which although not crucial may have served to balance the image better. More importantly it would have brought your main subject (the laughing lady) into the centre of the frame. The eye falls on her either way but if she was a little more centered it would make for a more comfortable viewing experience.

It's a pity that you have chosen to watermark it because the watermark gets in the way when I'm trying to evaluate the image and imagine what it looks like without that distraction.The data above says that the original image was 375x500 pixels. I imagine that's a mistake because all cameras these days are capable of capturing at a higher resolution that that.  375x500 pixels is about 1/5th of a megapixel!  I realise that you may have inadvertently set your camera to capture at one of its low resolution settings and you've had to go with what you got.Nevertheless, the large version of the image reveals itself to be 1200x1600 pixels when I examine it in an image editor. The conclusion I draw from this, Lily, is that you have resized (upsampled) the 375x500 pixel image to 1200x1600 and uploaded it. That's quite an upsize, and the result is that the image looks soft. It lacks definition in the details.But let's get past that and look at the image in general terms as a piece of visual communication. You wanted to convey the impression of an unexpected portrait of a person taking a distant look through a doorway while there were many people passing in the street; and perhaps the idea that this old lady was alone and frail.I think you've captured some of those things in this image. She looks concerned and alone to me. However, there is no clue in the image that she's being passed by, or ignored by other people in the street. Perhaps if the image showed a blurred glimpse of a passer by on one side of the frame the impression of the woman being ignored would be strong.Timing is everything in photojournalistic images like this. I realise that you may have spontaneously grabbed this photographic opportunity, and that you probably would have felt awkward if you'd stayed there longer waiting for all of the elements in your imagined story to come together to make the title \"Young trapped in an old coccoon\" resonate. I do get the feeling that the old lady has been sidelined from society more than that of a young-at-heart lady trapped in an old body.I wish you all the best with your photography, Lily.

For instance, the roofline on that interesting and compelling structure emmanates from the middle of the left frame (not the strongest entry point for a leading line), and terminates in mid sky line.  My eye wants it to join up with another line and continue taking me on some visual excursion.  Rather, it ends abruptly in the blue.  On a positive note, I do like the very nice alignment of the horizontal two by four in the shed structure, with the horizontal earth line in the background, as well as the repeating horizontal of the lighter grassy background line beyond. Similarly you have juxtaposed vertical lines in the sheds ribbing, and nice soft bending diagonals on the aluminum roof.  I also like the use of similar dark browns in the earth to mimic the color of the side of the shed, and the nice conical diagonals of the earth that tend to provide visual balance for the diagonal of the rooftop of the structure. I think that the meat of this compositionis the lower left quadrant of the frame and could well stand on its own as an art object.  I think in this case the plain blue sky simply acts as sort of a sink hole, drawing attention from the real meat of this image, lines of the shed, earth and grass.
